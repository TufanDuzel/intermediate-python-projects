# 🐍 Intermediate Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of **intermediate-level Python projects**.  
Each project in this repository was built to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals while exploring practical applications such as data structures, file handling, loops, and conditionals.

---

## 🧠 About
These projects are designed for developers who have already mastered Python basics and want to move a step forward into writing clean, logical, and functional code.  
Each folder represents a self-contained mini project written entirely in Python.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**
- Basic built-in modules (`random`, `string`, etc.)
- Command-line input/output (`input()`, `print()`)
- Lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TufanDuzel/intermediate-python-projects.git

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice logical thinking through small but structured projects
- Write clean, readable, and documented code
- Improve problem-solving skills by gradually adding new features

## 🧩 Next Steps
Future updates will include:
- JSON file saving/loading
- Error handling improvements
- GUI and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) versions of selected projects
